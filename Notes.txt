package.json is a package containing dependencies of npm (not package marker)(fake name)

command :
npm init/npm init -y


Most imp dependency:(Bundler) to enable the app to be pushed to production.Using parcel


there are 2 type of dependencies:
1 Dev dependency:Required for development phase.(Used in development phase)
2 Normal Dependency


"parcel":"^2.12.0"  (^ used to add minor new versions)
                    (- used to add major new versions)
                    don't use - coz we don't want to change to a major version change

what is difference between package.json and package-lock.json:
1.package-lock.json keeps track of all the exact versions which are installed
2.package.json keeps track of approximate versions.

 package-lock.json keeps contains an integrity (a Hash)to ensure the version which the user has should be same as in deployment


 Parcel needs a lot of dependencies called as transitive dependencies.
